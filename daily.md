# Daily Routines

This document covers Mordin's daily routines

## Morning

- if Mordin pooped:
    - wipe his butt
- if Mordin peed or pooped:
    - clean up pee and poop (see [cleanup instructions](cleanup.md))
    - remove pee pad (assuming it's dirty)
    - prop up pee pad holder
- let him outside (on the balcony) to pee
- feed him:
    - I usually feed him anywhere between 11am and 1pm
    - put 1 cup kibble into bowl (he uses one bowl throughout each day)
    - place bowl on floor in front of his pen
    - make him do tricks
    - "okay" to let him know he can eat
        - if he tries to eat before you've said "okay", tell him to "leave it"
    - once he's done, put water in the bowl (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 full, so as to
      reduce spillage)

## Night

- feed him (same as in the morning)
    - I usually feed him at 11pm
    - use the same bowl as in the morning; empty it of water and do a quick
      rinse with water (no scrubbing) before filling with 1 cup kibble
- before bed:
    - let him outside to pee
    - prepare a pee pad on the pee pad holder and lay it flat on the ground in
      the corner
    - give him one vitamin tablet (white bottle with green label, "NuVet Plus",
      on the A/C unit in the living room)
    - close Mordin in his pen (*NOT* in his crate) so he can walk around a
      little bit and has access to his pee pad

## Throughout the Day

- allow him to walk around the apartment and play with his toys
- he is not allowed on the couch, bed, and yoga mats (even if it's just a paw)
    - he is allowed on the bathmat
- put him in timeout (in his crate) if he's misbehaving or not listening
    - leave him there for 5+ minutes.  Let him out whenever you want; just make
      sure he doesn't pee/poop in his crate.
- pee schedule
    - if he paws at the balcony door, let him out (to the balcony) immediately
        - recently, he's been impatient, so if he paws at the door and you
          don't respond/let him out within ~30 seconds, he'll start peeing on
          the floor
    - on average, he pees maybe once every 2-4 hours.  You can proactively let
      him out if you need to shower, take a meeting, whatever
- if you're leaving the apartment:
    - make sure to take him out to the balcony to pee
        - you can try telling him "go potty"; this sometimes works, sometimes
          doesn't
    - prepare his pee pad
    - prepare a chew toy for him.  Your choices are:
        - Kong toy: filled with kibble and water, then frozen (probably at
          least the night before)
        - rubber ball: spread with some peanut butter in 4 of the sets of teeth
            - make sure the rubber ball is cleaned with soap first
            - use the peanut butter on the kitchen counter (it's his peanut
              butter)
            - you can reuse the knife
    - leave the chew toy in his crate
    - lock him in the pen (use the top two locks on the pen door)
    - keep a light on if you might not be back before dark
- take him out for a 15-30 minute walk, once a day, whenever you have time
    - some days, I'll skip the walk if I'm super busy or if it's raining out
        - on these days, I make more of an effort to play fetch with him inside
          so he gets some exercise
    - on the walk:
        - he should wear both his harness and his collar
            - the harness is to clip his leash to, so you have more control of
              him without tugging at his neck
            - the collar is for identification/licenses
        - look out for dog poop and glass, and keep him away
            - if you see glass, you can pick him up and hold him until you're
              past the glass
        - if he pees or poops, give him a ton of excited "good boy"s and pets,
          and give a treat if you have one on you
        - Mordin's curious but shy around other dogs; he can greet them, but
          he doesn't always want to
        - if you want, you can take him up/down the stairs in the building
            - I do this if the walk is shorter, so he can tire himself out a
              bit more
    - after the walk:
        - let him inside the apartment (while still on leash), but keep him by
          the shoerack.  Tell him to "sit" and "stay" while you take off your
          shoes/jacket/whatever, then take off his leash, harness, and collar,
          complimenting him with "good boy"s for being patient.
        - pick him up and put him in the bathtub
        - wash his paws (see ["Cleaning Mordin's
          paws"](cleanup.md#step-3-cleaning-mordins-paws-of-poop))
        - take him back out on the balcony in case he needs to pee
        - make sure he has water
