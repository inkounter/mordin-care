## Medicine

Right now, Mordin has 3 prescribed drugs:

- Probiotics
- Panacur
- Metronidazole

The probiotics and Panacur are served once a day (at night) with his food.
Each serving of Panacur comes in a little plastic bag.  Sprinkle it over his
food.  Each serving of probiotics is contained in one pill. Screw open the pill
and pour its contents over his food.  Once the Panacur and probiotics are in
his food, mix it somewhat thoroughly so that Mordin doesn't pick it out.

The Metronidazole is served twice a day.  For ease, serve it *at the same time*
as his food but not *in* his food.  (Mordin often picks out the Metronidazole
if he can.)  Each serving of Metronidazole is a solid tablet. Take
approximately 1-2 teaspoons of peanut butter (using the butter knife), move the
portion from the knife to your index finger, and stick the tablet into the
peanut butter.  The peanut butter doesn't need to totally cover the tablet.
Make Mordin do 2-3 tricks, then offer your finger with the tablet and peanut
butter to him.  While he's licking it (vigorously), make sure he laps up the
pill.

## Congee

While Mordin is taking these drugs, he eats congee instead of kibble, since the
drugs may make his stomach more sensitive and congee is more easily digested.

To make the congee:
- Use the large pot (with handles).
- Pour 2.5 cups of dry white rice into the pot.
- Clean the rice.
- Fill the pot up to the top of the boltholes for the handles.
- Put the pot on the bottom left burner of the stove, and turn to high
  heat.
- Take one prepared portion of frozen diced chicken from the freezer (bottom
  shelf, in a Ziploc bag), and add it to the pot.
- Once the water reaches a rolling boil, turn the burner to low heat (at "1" on
  the handle, for the bottom left burner).  At this setting, it should be
  simmering.  Start a timer for 60 minutes.
- Using the rubber spatula (so as not to scratch the pot, which is nonstick),
  stir every 15-20 minutes to make sure the bottom doesn't dry out and burn.
- You can also try to separate the frozen chicken into smaller pieces as it
  thaws, although this isn't super critical.
- After 40 minutes, the congee should be about done, but you can let it
  continue to simmer up to the 60 minutes if you're not in a rush.
- Let it cool before serving.

One pot should make 4 meals (spread across 2 days).  Put the lid on and store
it in the refrigerator.  You can leave the spatula in the pot in the
refrigerator so you don't have to clean it after every use.  Upon serving, you
can add water to make it easier to mix with the drugs.  Note that once
refrigerated, the congee is more solid, so it's easy to split the pot into 4
"pie slices".

## Going back to kibble

For any meal that is not accompanied by Metronidazole, feed kibble.
